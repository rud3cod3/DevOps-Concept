## So i was working with the commits and i accidentlly removed the changes now there is still one way even if you use hard reset 

git reflog                                       # find your lost commit hash
git checkout -b recovery-branch 8a8f6bb          # create a new branch from that commit
git switch main                                  # switch to main branch
git merge recovery-branch                        # merge the lost changes back into main
git branch -d recovery-branch                    # delete the temporary recovery branch
